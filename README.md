# Korean Civil Service Exam (Gwageo) Dataset EDA

This project explores and analyzes datasets related to the **Joseon Dynasty's civil service examination (Gwageo)**, including the *Mungwa Bangmok* (official lists of successful candidates) and other historical exam records.

## Overview

The Joseon Dynasty (1392–1897) operated a rigorous civil service examination system to recruit government officials. The *Mungwa* (문과, Literary Examination) was the highest-level exam, and its records provide valuable insights into the era's social, educational, and political landscape.

## Dataset Description

- **Mungwa Bangmok**: Lists of successful candidates, including names, hometowns, family backgrounds, and exam years.
- **Other Exam Records**: Data on preliminary and secondary exams, exam questions, and examiner information.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA focuses on:

- **Demographic Analysis**: Distribution of successful candidates by region, family, and social class.
- **Temporal Trends**: Changes in exam participation and success rates over time.
- **Network Analysis**: Connections among candidates, examiners, and influential families.
- **Text Analysis**: Examination of exam questions and candidate essays (if available).
